    PSK31 support in gMFSK borrows heavily from the C++ modem classes written
    by Hansi Reiser DL9RDZ (which in turn is partly derived from the work of
    Andrew Senior G0TJZ and Peter Martinez G3PLX). While I have not used any
    code directly, much of the architecture and algorithms are almost directly
    copied from there.

If you are an author and I have failed to cite you, please let me
know.  If you contributed your code to gMFSK, twpsk, fldigi,
PocketDigi, or DRM780, then it is already licensed under GPL and I
but I will still add your name here.
